**Python: Temperature Converter**

Description:
"Temperature Converter" is a mini-project written in the Python programming language, designed to provide an easy and quick way to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. The program offers a convenient method for converting temperatures between these two most commonly used temperature scales, making it useful for everyday tasks and understanding different temperature measurement systems.

Key Features of the Project:

1. Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion: Enter a temperature in Celsius, and the program will automatically convert it to the corresponding Fahrenheit value using the standard conversion formula.

2. Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion: Similarly, input a temperature in Fahrenheit, and the program will perform the reverse conversion, providing the value in Celsius.

3. Simple and Intuitive Interface: The project provides a straightforward input and output through the command-line or a user interface (GUI), making it user-friendly, even for beginners.

4. Error Handling: The program includes error handling to handle incorrect inputs, such as non-numeric values for temperature, ensuring smooth execution and reliable performance.

How to Use the Project:

1. Run the Program: Execute the "temperature_converter.py" script in a Python runtime environment.

2. Choose the Conversion Mode: The program will prompt you to choose the conversion mode by entering "1" for Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion or "2" for Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion.

3. Input the Temperature: After selecting the mode, enter the temperature in the appropriate scale, and the program will display the converted result.

4. Reuse or Exit: You can reuse the program to convert other temperatures or exit as needed.

This project will enhance your understanding of working with variables, input/output operations, and conditional statements in Python. It also serves as an excellent starting project for those who are embarking on their programming journey using the Python programming language.
